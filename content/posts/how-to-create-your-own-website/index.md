I will be going over why I decided to create my own website and how you can do the same using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Blowfish theme](https://blowfish.page/).

## Why

I got my inspiration to create this site from Luke Smith, specifically from this [video](https://youtu.be/ZFL09qhKi5I) he made about Hugo. Realizing how easy it was to make a website and his thoughts on internet independence (becoming a internet landlord) really resonated with me.

Don't get me wrong, sites like [Medium](https://medium.com/) and [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/) are great for posting articles. However, I wanted to have the freedom with having a personal site hosted somewhere. Medium and Hashnode are only meant for posting articles, while with a personal site you can post articles and do whatever else you would like to do. 

Here is a quick list of all the reasons why I choose to create my own site.
- To have internet independence as stated previously. In other words, relying less on platforms or services like social media and creating your own. 
- A place to share my projects, thoughts, and ideas and to help other people at the same time. As well as having one place that I could put stuff within instead of having separate things on multiple sites.
- Resume booster and personal branding.
- Most importantly, **creative output**. I feel like this is something that is not talked about as much as it needs to be. Having an outlet to where you can be creative is important since it is direct expression of who you are. 
- Finally, a quote that I enjoy. "*Find three hobbies you love: One to make you money, one to keep you in shape and one to be creative.*" Why not have 2 of the hobbies be connected in some way?
