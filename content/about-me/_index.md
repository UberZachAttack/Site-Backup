Hello, my name is Zach. I have a strong interest within cybersecurity, specifically offensive security. 

I graduated from Penn State in May of 2022 with a Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity Analytics and Operations and a minor in Security Risk Analysis. During my time at Penn State, I joined a cybersecurity club and participated in multiple cybersecurity-related competitions. Some of them include CCDC, CPTC, PicoCTF, and National Cyber League.

I am currently studying network penetration testing and host exploitation.

More information about my work experience, certifications that I hold, and personal contact information can be found [here](/about-me/more-info).
